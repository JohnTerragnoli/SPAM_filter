re  paul choi
house warming bash  stacy  s
chuck  s numbers he walked you through earlier assumed 100 bps in fees so we are slightly better than forecast  the 65 bps was comp for the original transaction for which we drafted dox and received ratings from s  p and moodys  had we not run into the el paso issues the number would have held  given that the new structure requires a new market  new rating agency process and new documentation  we are effectively documenting and selling a new second transaction  an increase in the fee for this substantial change of the deal is market  i still believe a sept 30 closing is unrealistic  if all goes well  i think we can be done by mid oct  to reach a sept 30 closing  i think the only option would be to ask bank of america to underwrite and buy the whole thing  that would likely be an expensive option  we can discuss in much more detail at our 9 am mtg tomorrow  i  d be hesitant to show panic that we must sell the asset at any price prior to sep 30 and trade real economic value and negotiate from a weaker position when we can have a clean sale 2 weeks later  ideally before 3 q earnings release   the assets are still warehoused off balance sheet and fortunately el paso  s credit spreads have been trading in to our benefit  just my thoughts  ps  your gift made my day  i  m fully recovered and back on pace  thanks

thanks for taking time this morning to go over some goals for enrononline  as far as i  m concerned  the platform we have is astonishing  and i agree that the more we lengthen our lead over the competition  in both trading and technology  the better our chances of landing some private marketplace sales  to that end  jay and i will begin hounding the trading heads and rounding up development needs and potential enhancements to boost trade volume and revenue  also  we  ll get kal focused on periodic face  lifts of the gui  then we will devote origination attention to third party sales which will validate our contention that the platform has value outside of its considerable worth to enron  if resources become constrained  it will simply mean that we are finding traction in the right places

re our meeting yesteday and discussion concerning energy capital resources  you are entirely correct that  from a management control standpoint  any investment whose performance falls well short of its approved projected financial profile should be considered for transfer into a  special  or  management scrutiny  portfolio  the only issue  then  is whether the charter of energy capital is an exception to that general control principle

they best way to manage your day gas problem would be to find counterparties that you are long last day prompt swaps  that are expiring now   and take them off throughout the day  for example  if a counterparty wants to reduce settlement risk  you can have a futures broker help manage match swaps counterparties and do an offsetting futures position  from which you can get long futures

hey guys  i would like to get with you to discuss our hedge policies  i am concerned about the recent accounting around the wind hedge  and not necessarlily the outcome in this particular case    if the outcome had been reversed  ie  a loss on the hedges existed  we would have had no choice but to book it  the issue is that nobody commmunicated or documented the designation of these positions as hedges of the  wind  ppa  it occurs to me that we do not have any process that requires coodination when you set up an accrual book  as you know the designation criteria are rigid for acctg purposes  if we miss it  we can  t cure it and the acctg would be mtm for the life of the contracts  i will set a metting to discuss
